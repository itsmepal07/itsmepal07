## Hi, I'm Palak Tank ##
I'm a student and aspiring AI/ML engineer, exploring how technology can solve real-world problems in education, mental health, and creative industries.

Right now, I'm learning by building — working on projects like an AI-powered grading assistant, a sentiment-aware mental health companion, and a fashion trend tracker using social media data.

What I'm currently exploring:
Machine learning with Python and Hugging Face

Using NLP for emotion and intent detection

Prototyping with Gemini API and Google Colab

Visualizing trends and user behavior

I'm still early in my journey and figuring things out one step at a time — but I'm always curious, always building, and always learning.
